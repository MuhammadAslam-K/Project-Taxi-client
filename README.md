# Taxi Booking App

This project is a taxi booking application consisting of two main modules: **User** and **Driver**.

## Modules

### User Module
- **User Account Creation**: Users can create accounts to access the application.
- **Ride Booking**: Users can book rides within the app.
- **Chat with Driver**: Real-time chat functionality is available for users to communicate with drivers.

### Driver Module
- **Booking Management**: Drivers can search and manage incoming ride bookings.
- **Accept Rides**: Drivers have the ability to accept ride requests from users.
- **Chat with User**: Real-time chat functionality allows drivers to communicate with users.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Development**: Developed using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - a fast web development build tool.
- **Language**: TypeScript was used instead of JavaScript for enhanced type safety and development productivity.
- **State Management**: [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) were employed for efficient state management across the application.
- **Form Handling**: Utilized [Formik](https://formik.org/) for seamless form handling.
- **Validation**: [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) schema validation was integrated for form validation.
- **Authentication**: Implemented [JWT (JSON Web Tokens)](https://jwt.io/) for secure user authentication.
- **Real-time Communication**: Utilized [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) for real-time chat functionality between users and drivers.
- **HTTP Requests**: [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) library was used for making API calls along with Axios interceptors for request/response handling.
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) was used for a utility-first approach to styling the application.

## Backend

- **Database**: MongoDB was used as the database for storing application data.
- **Server**: Node.js with Express was used to create the backend server.
